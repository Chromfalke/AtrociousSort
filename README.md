# AtrociousSort
This project's purpose is to provide Rust with blazingly fast (not guaranteed) implementations of some of the most useless sorting algorithms out there.

List of planned algorithms
- Quantum Bogo Sort (As soon as I can figure out how to access other universes)
- Tableflip Sort (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

List of implemented algorithms
- Stalinsort
- Inteligent Design Sort
- Sleep Sort
- Slowsort
- Bogo Sort
- Bogobogo Sort
- Stooge Sort

All algorithms contain one or more of the following features
- has a horrible runtime
- messes up your array in such a way that you wish you sorted it manually
- might not actually sort an array according to your expectations

### Motivation
Essentially, I saw a video on YouTube talking about "unconventional" (completely bonkers) sorting algorithms and wanted to implement some of them that I found interesting. Additionally I wanted to use this project for learning how to properly develod and maintain a libraray on crates.io.

### Usage
**Warning**: If you intend to use this crate in any serious manner or productive environment you should have your programming privileges revoked.

### Performance
If one of the implemented algorithms happens to have a good performance, you'll pay for it another way.

### Limitations
See everything above.
